# School District Analysis
## Overview
A chief data scientist for a city school district has given tasks to analyze and report student funding and standardized test scores as below:
- A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format.
- An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format.
- Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
  - Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate.
  - The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school.
  - The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school.
  - School performance based on the budget per student.
  - School performance based on the school size.
  - School performance based on the type of school.
- Analyze and compare the above school metrics while excluding the ninth grade reading and math scores of Thomas High School.

## School District Results
The district and school summary along with other metrics  were calculated for the school district initially. Later on, the reading and math scores of **461** students in the ninth grade of Thomas High School were turned into null data due to academic dishonesty. The school metrics were recalculated to observe the impact.
